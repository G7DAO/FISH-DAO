# FISH DAO

Tragedy of the Commons On Chain

[What is the tragedy of the commons? - Nicholas Amendolare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxC161GvMPc)

Summary
FISH DAO is a game theory game used to understand how individuals will behave when given a
shared resource. Players will vote on how much resources they should take. The data will
gauge participation and health of the DAO.



## Problem
Tragedy of the commons is a situation in which individuals with access to a shared resource
(also called a common) act in their own interest and, in doing so, ultimately deplete the
resource.

## Solution
FISH DAO solves the problem by creating a transparent platform for participation. We can
measure the health of a community. If there are no rules (no DAO), fisherman will over harvest.
This game will enable a community to manage their own resource while still benefiting
themselves. The rules (DAO), will be flexible. Up to the community to set.

## Getting Started
There is a pool of fish. The pool of fish (ERC-20) reproduce at a certain rate. The more fish in
the pool, the more they reproduce. Fisherman with fish are able to vote on how many fish they
can harvest per day. Only fisherman who vote can harvest the catch (promotes participation).
